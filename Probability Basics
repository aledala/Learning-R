P(A 1 ∪ A 2 ) = P(A 1 ) + P(A 2 ), If A1 and A2 are disjoint
Property A P(A c ) = 1 − P(A)
P(∅) = 0
If A ⊂ B, then P(A) ≤ P(B). This property states that if B occurs
whenever A occurs, then P(A) ≤ P(B).
Addition Law: Addition Law P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)
Permutation:
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. Suppose that from the set
C = {c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c n } we choose r elements and list them in order.
With replacement:
The first ball can be chosen in any of n ways, the second in any
of n ways, etc., so that there are n × n × · · · × n = n power r samples

For a set of size n and a sample of size r , there are n r different ordered 
samples with replacement and n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − r + 1) different orderedsamples without replacement.

The number of orderings of n elements is n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · 1 = n!
Grouping classes:

Combinations:
The number of unordered
samples of r objects selected from n objects without
replacement is 
(n)
 r .
 
 Conditional Probability:
 
 P(A | B) =P(A ∩ B)/P(B)
 
 P(A) =sigma 1 to n P(A | B i )P(B i )
 A and B are said to be independent events if P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B).
 
 Random Variables:
 
A random variable is essentially a random number. As motivation for a definition, let
us consider an example. A coin is thrown three times, and the sequence of heads and
tails is observed; thus,
OMEGA= {hhh, hht, htt, hth, ttt, tth, thh, tht}
Examples of random variables defined on OMEGA are (1) the total number of heads, (2) the
total number of tails, and (3) the number of heads minus the number of tails. Each of
these is a real-valued function defined on omega

Bernoulli Random Variables:
A Bernoulli random variable takes on only two values: 0 and 1, with probabilities
1 − p and p, respectively. Its frequency function is thus
p(1) = p
p(0) = 1 − p
p(x) = 0,if x =0 and x =1
